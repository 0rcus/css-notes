selectors are ways of grabbing and manipulating html.
                                    ELEMENT selectors
EX: To grab a paragraph and change its color,
you would type 
p {
    color: red;
}
                            CLASS Selector 
To select elements within a certain class name
There are class heirarchies
example <p class="aclass">Some Text</p>
                            ID Selector 
superior to class, but can only be used on one element at a time,
and is selected with the # symbol. It is possible to use more than once though
example 
<p id="something">Some Text</p>

 use a # for ids

 open brackets for coding

 class is superior to header
 id is superior to class
 inline styling is superior to class
 HOW TO USE CLASSES AND IDS IN HTML USING CSS
prefix for a class is . and you select it by typing its name in 
then in the curly brackets u type the properties
select ids with #
end string with ; when dealing with properties
                                ADVANCED SELECTORS
General Sibling Selector selects elements directly after one another in the same family. 
Example:
USE THIS IN CSS
textarea ~ button {
    
}
TO CHANGE THIS IN HTML
<form>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Full Name">
    <input type="email" placeholder="Email">
    <textarea></textarea>
    <button>Submit</button>
</form>
Adjacent Sibling Selector selects elements that diirectly follow another element.
Example: 
USE THIS IN css
h2 + a {

}
TO CHANGE THIS IN HTML
<h2>Heading 2.</h2>
<a href="https://pornhub.com" target="_blank" id="porn">porn</a>
CHILD SELECTOR
Selects every child of an element.
EXAMPLE: 
USE THIS IN css
ul > li {
    
}
TO CHANGE THIS IN <html>
    <ul>
        <li>List item.</li>
    </ul>
DESCENDANT SELECTOR
Used to select items inside of elements as children
EXAMPLE: 
Use this in CSS
ul li {
    
}
TO CHANGE THIS IN html
<ul>
    <li>List item.</li>
    <li><ol>
        <li>List Item.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ul>
ATTRIBUTE SELECTORS
Uses the attributes of elements to change their values
EXAMPLE USE THIS IN CSS 
img[src="blah.jpg"]
p[id="beep"]
etc
SO 
h2[class=subtitle]{
    color: blue;
}
Would change this in <HTML>
 <h2 class="subtitle">Text</h2>
to a blue color
TO SELECT TWO IMAGES THAT START WITH SAME SOURCE BUT ARENT EXACT
DO 
img[src^="start of source" {
    border: 10px black;
}
it has to be exact
but that would change any photo with that starting chain to have a 
border

another way to search is using the * instead of ^, but instead searches for 
anywhere in the image.
For example, if i had two images 
<img src="OIP.jpg">
<img src="OENFIANFOIPDAN.jpg">
and I used the string 
img[src*="OIP"] {}
It would still select both because they both contain OIP

You can add multiple classes to elements seperated by spaces
limited to a very small number of attributes using spaces

<h2 class="subtitle article-subtitle">Text</h2>

h2[class~=article-subtitle]{

}

                                                          PROPERTIES
Properties are contained within selectors {
   like this, and they target the element
}
They always use a colon and a semicolon
the colon comes after the property, and the semicolon comes
after the value.

in color: green; COLOR is the property, and GREEN is the value.
There are many properties and values, with many different uses

                                    GENERAL CSS RULES
Selectors and properties work together 
THERE are three parts to the selector 

The selector itself, 
the curly braces, and the properties.

selector {
    property: value;
    property2: value2;
}
                                                                    CSS BLOCK
After you select something, you have to define its styles. 
Inbetween the curly braces is where the styles go, which is called
a block.
You can have more than one property, which means you could change 
background, color, and fontsize all at once.
This basic form is kept for almost all css code.
                                                                   styling
Coloring in General and techniques
there are colors given by name, and also more than the names
there are three different types of colors
#1 are the CSS color codes (the names)
#2 are the Hex Codes (#19abf5) 3 groups of 2 numbers representing r, g, and b
numbers go from 1-9 to a-f which means ff would be most of a color and 11 would be less
#3 are RGB codes, which are formatted in r,g,b and the numbers go from 0-255 

                                                                    COLORING TEXT
selector {
    color:color;
    background:color;
}
to change background of all, then put body as selector
                                                                BACKGROUNDS
to use an image as a background, use the image address 
THEN 
use property background, then as the value, put url("")
and paste the image into the quotations
instead of pasting the image address, you can also use a regular 
image url, locally

You can also use very specific properties that stand for 
very specific values
    background-img, which only works for url("") values
    background-color, which only works for rgb values

To get rid of image repeating on image backgrounds, you can use
background-repeat: no-repeat
but that makes it only take up a small box.
so, you will need to resize the image using this cmd
    background-size: height width;
or by using the value contain or cover
Cover stretches the image to cover the full width
contain makes the image as big as it can without messing with proportions
                                                                                OPACITY/TRANSPARENCY
IN RGB THERE ARE 3 COLOR VALUES AND ONE HIDDEN VALUE KNOWN AS THE ALPHA VALUE
AFTER THE FINAL VALUE, ANY VALUE BETWEEN 0-1 WILL CHANGE OPACITY OF
YOUR COLORING
                                                                                GRADIENTS
Radial gradients are circular
    Selector {
        prop: radial-gradient(color min%, color med%, color big%)
    }
    to specify shape type the name before colors in the parentheses
Linear gradients are smooth transitions
    Selector {
        prop: linear-gradient(to direction, color, color, color);}
to make gradients diagonal, indicate bottom right or left etc or give 
angle degrees using (numdeg, color, color, etc)
