Element Selectors
    Basics
        selectors are ways of grabbing and manipulating html.
        EX: To grab a paragraph and change its color,
        you would type 
        p {
            color: red;
        }
    CLASS Selector 
        To add a class to an element, you'd want to type class="class"
        example <p class="aclass">Some Text</p>
    ID Selector 
        different from class, more specific
        <p id="something">Some Text</p>

        use a # for ids

        
    Selector Hierarchy
        class is superior to header
        id is superior to class
        inline styling is superior to class
    HOW TO USE CLASSES AND IDS IN HTML USING CSS
        prefix for a class is . and you select it by typing its name in 
        then in the curly brackets u type the properties
        select ids with #
        end string with ; when dealing with properties
ADVANCED SELECTORS
    General Sibling Selector 
        selects elements directly after one another in the same family. 
        Example:
        USE THIS IN CSS
        textarea ~ button {
            
        }
        TO CHANGE THIS IN HTML
        <form>

            <textarea></textarea>
            <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
    Adjacent Sibling Selector 
        selects elements that directly follow another element.
        Example: 
        USE THIS IN css
        h2 + a {

        }
        TO CHANGE THIS IN HTML
        <h2>Heading 2.</h2>
        <a href="https://pornhub.com" target="_blank" id="porn">porn</a>
    CHILD SELECTOR
        Selects every child of an element.
        EXAMPLE: 
        USE THIS IN css
        ul > li {
            
        }
        TO CHANGE THIS IN <html>
            <ul>
                <li>List item.</li>
            </ul>
    DESCENDANT SELECTOR
        Used to select items inside of elements as children
        EXAMPLE: 
        Use this in CSS
        ul li {
            
        }
        TO CHANGE THIS IN html
        <ul>
            <li>List item.</li>
            <li><ol>
                <li>List Item.</li>
            </ol></li>
        </ul>
     ATTRIBUTE SELECTORS
        Uses the attributes of elements to change their values
        EXAMPLE USE THIS IN CSS 
        img[src="blah.jpg"]
        p[id="beep"]
        etc
        SO 
        h2[class=subtitle]{
            color: blue;
        }
        Would change this in <HTML>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Text</h2>
        to a blue color
        TO SELECT TWO IMAGES THAT START WITH SAME SOURCE BUT ARENT EXACT
        DO 
        img[src^="start of source" {
            border: 10px black;
        }
        it has to be exact
        but that would change any photo with that starting chain to have a 
        border

        another way to search is using the * instead of ^, but instead searches for 
        anywhere in the image.
        For example, if i had two images 
        <img src="OIP.jpg">
        <img src="OENFIANFOIPDAN.jpg">
        and I used the string 
        img[src*="OIP"] {}
        It would still select both because they both contain OIP

        You can add multiple classes to elements seperated by spaces
        limited to a very small number of attributes using spaces

        <h2 class="subtitle article-subtitle">Text</h2>

        h2[class~=article-subtitle]{

        }


GENERAL CSS RULES
    Selectors & Properties
        Selectors and properties work together 
        There are three parts to the selector:
        The selector itself, 
        the curly braces,
        and the properties and values.

        selector {
            property: value;
            property2: value2;
        }
CSS BLOCK
    Styles
        After you select something, you have to define its styles. 
        Inbetween the curly braces is where the styles go, which is called
        a block.
    Property Limit
        You can have more than one property, which means you could change 
        background, color, and fontsize all at once.
        This basic form is kept for almost all css code.
Coloring Basics
    Coloring in General and techniques
        there are colors given by name, and also more than the names
        there are three different types of colors
        #1 are the CSS color codes (the names)
        #2 are the Hex Codes (#19abf5) 3 groups of 2 numbers representing r, g, and b
        numbers go from 1-9 to a-f which means ff would be most of a color and 11 would be less
        #3 are RGB codes, which are formatted in r,g,b and the numbers go from 0-255 

COLORING
        selector {
            color:color;
            background:color;
        }
        to change background of full page, then put body as selector
BACKGROUNDS
    Image Backgrounds
        to use an image as a background, use the image address 
        THEN 
        use property background, then as the value, put url("")
        and paste the image into the quotations
        instead of pasting the image address, you can also use a regular 
        image url, locally
    Specific Properties
        You can also use very specific properties that stand for 
        very specific values
            background-img, which only works for url("") values
            background-color, which only works for rgb values
    Sizing
        To get rid of image repeating on image backgrounds, you can use
        background-repeat: no-repeat
        but that makes it only take up a small box.
        so, you will need to resize the image using this cmd
            background-size: height width;
        or by using the value contain or cover
        Cover stretches the image to cover the full width
        contain makes the image as big as it can without messing with proportions
OPACITY/TRANSPARENCY
    IN RGB THERE ARE 3 COLOR VALUES AND ONE HIDDEN VALUE KNOWN AS THE ALPHA VALUE
    THE ALPHA VALUE CONTROLS OPACITY
    AFTER THE FINAL RGB VALUE, ANY VALUE BETWEEN 0-1 WILL CHANGE OPACITY OF
    YOUR COLORING
GRADIENTS
    Radial gradients 
        circular
            Selector {
                prop: radial-gradient(color min%, color med%, color big%);
            }
        to specify shape type the name before colors in the parentheses
    Linear gradients
        smooth transitions
            Selector {
                prop: linear-gradient(to direction, color, color, color);
            }
        to make gradients diagonal, indicate bottom right or left etc or give 
        angle degrees using (numdeg, color, color, etc)
UNITS
        There are two types of units
    Absolute and Relative Units
        For example, the px unit in height and width values is absolute
        this is the same for inches, centimeters, etc.
        They aren't affected by anything around them.
        The next type are relative units. These depend on certain elements
        for example, % units will always make a certain image take up whatever % of your screen.
        There are a lot of different relative values, but first we will talk about pixels.
        Pixels are special because although px are absolute, they are also relatively scaled based on what device you are on.
        The concept of DPI in computing depends on your amount of pixels in the screen.
        To be basic, high resolution devices will see pixels differently than low pixel devices.
        For example, a 400px image on an HD TV would be smaller than the same image on a low res device.

    ABSOLUTE UNITS
        if I was changing font-size
            I would need to put in a value for the size, such as cm or in.
            there are also pt, or points which are a little bit bigger than pixels.
            1 pc, which is similar, is worth 12 points.
        another one is em. it represents the size relative to the current value of whatever your property is 
    RELATIVE UNITS
        some relative units are view width and view height.
        (vw and vh)
        These allow you to work with the viewport, which is basically your whole shown screen
        it almost works the same as percentages, but it is also way different.
        the problem with absolute units is that they are too specific, and can mess things up
        if you're using a different device than the site was intended for.
TEXT MANIPULATION
        This section will cover text manipulation and font manipulation.
        Text manipulation is looking at things you can change no matter the font.
        Underlining, capitalization, etc are not dependent on the font.
        italics, bolding, and size are all font-dependent

    TEXT Decoration
        The only real thing you can do with this is change the lining of the text.
        So, you'd select the text you want to change and Use
        text-decoration: none; which removes the lines from links
        text-decoration: line-through; which puts a line through the text
        or text-decoration: underline/overline, which are self explanatory.


    Text Transform
        so lets say you want to change every word in your text or change its properties
        you'd use text-transform:
        and you can use 3 different values for This
        uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize.
        capitalize makes every first letter of a word capitalized, and uppercase and lowercase change every character.

    Text Align
        This is different in the sense that it's not focused on styling or 
        decorating your text. it's more focused on the justification or alignment of it.
        There are four main alignments in css
        use the prop text-align: 
        and you can use either center, left, right, or justify
        justify takes all the text, and sets all of the lines the same length.
        center, left, and right are pretty ez to understand.

FONT SIZE, BOLDING & STYLE 
    Font size
        To change font size, you're going to use prop font-size:
        and then for the value you're going to put any size value, such as em, vw, vh, px, etc.


    Font weight
        What font weight decides is the bolding of a font. The value can change from 0, which is nothing, to infinity.
        However, most fonts only go up to 800-900.
        use font-weight
        and then for the value, just type any number between 0-800
        it's advised to go up by hundreds when editing this value.
        400 is considered normal, or default bolding

    Font style
        Font style is for italicizing. 
        A way to do that is to create a <span></span> tag around your wanted italicized text
        give it a class, such as "italics"
        then select the class in css, 
        and use property font-style
        then, you'll want to either set it to normal, italic, or oblique.
        oblique is just a little bit more italicized

    FONT FAMILIES
        Font families are collections of fonts that have similar features. 
        There are 3 default families: serif, sans-serif, and monospace.

        Serif is pretty much default, and it has small lines on the 
        end of some letters which it makes it hard to read on computer.

        Sans-serif groups are the ones that don't have lines, which means they are far 
        easier to read.

        Monospace is pretty much where all characters have the same width, 
        which means they all take up the same space, as opposed to serif or sans-serif

        Good examples of a serif font are Times New Roman and Georgia
        Sans-Serif fonts would be Arial and Calibri
        Monospace would be Courier New

        It all just depends on what result you want.

        So, to change font families you're gonna want to use property
        font-family: 
        and then as the value you type whatever font you want.
        after that font, you can set a backup for if your original font doesn't work
        this is achieved by simply using a comma, and then typing a different font 
        or your current font's family.

    Including External Fonts with google fonts
        Your computer will likely come preloaded with a bunch of fonts
        however, you can get fonts from the internet at
        https://fonts.google.com
        you can find a bunch of fonts there.

        select your fonts, and then copy and
        paste the link tag ABOVE THE STYLE SHEET
        Then, apply your fonts using the directions stated previously,
        using the names of your new fonts and blah blah blahb you get it.
CSS: THE BOX MODEL
        The CSS Box Model is a series of positioning properties
        designed to help with layout. Each property works in a different
        way, and positions the item with different spacing.
        The Box Model is the most commonly used way to position items.

        The model consists of Content, Padding, Border, and Margin.
        each layer can be stretched and sized either symmetrically 
        or asymetrically.
        The center contains the content, and there is an invisible box 
        around the content which is made up of three layers.

            Padding
        Padding represents the space between the content and the border.
        It's meant to give more room around the content itself, not move 
        the content around.
            Border
        The border is the divider between the padding and margin.
        It can be styled using a CSS property called border
            Margin
        The margin is the space between the border and all other content.
        it is to give room and spacing around external elements.
    USING THE BOX MODEL
            Units to use on a page: 
        Use pixels or an absolute unit for height, 
        and then use a relative unit for width.
        it keeps both values consistent.
        ex: 
        item{
            height: 400px;
            width: 70vw;
        }
    CSS BORDERS
        There are many different styles for borders, 
        but it is easier to use the shorthand to style everything
        at once.
            How to add a border:
        item{
            border: size style color;
        }
        Styles for your border include dotted, dashed, solid, and double.
        
    CSS Padding and Margin
        To add margins or padding to the item, you're going to want to first choose
        something to manipulate.
        Next, you'll want to use the shorthand margin or padding property
        item {
            padding: size;
            margin: size;
        }

        Margins add space outside the item, and padding adds it inside.
            You can also use dashes and the side you want to 
            add the margins or padding to.
            ex:
        item {
            padding-right: 40px;
        }
            At the same time, you can also change all four sides at once
            by separating values going clockwise starting from the top using spaces.
        item {
            margin: top, right, bottom, left;
            (and if you put just two categories this will happen)
            margin: top bottom, right left;
        }
Float & Display types
        Two properties we are going to be looking at are 
            Float 
            AND
            Display

        first of all, there are block elements and inline elements.
        block elements move things into their own category or blocks
        and inline elements just flow with their block.
    Float
        So, what float does is change how the item you've selected 
        shows on the page. 
        you can make things float to certain sides of your page
            ex:
        item{
            float: right;
        }
        this would move the item to the right of the page, moving the item
        before it into its blank spot.
        The next value is inherit, which is used with child elements.
        so, if there is a div with an image in it, and we set the div's float, then 
        we can use the inherit value to apply that same value to the child being the image.
        
        Then, there is float:none;
        which does pretty much nothing.
    Display
        Display has multiple properties, which all affect your items and how 
        they appear on your screen.
        There are multiple values for display, 
        starting with 
            display: none;
        this almost completely deletes your item from view.

        the next display type is 
            display: inline-block;
        and what this does is it combines both inline and block properties,
        which can give it its own space while also not changing how it appears.
CSS: Flexbox
        Flexbox covers advanced techniques for formatting your page.
    Introduction
        Flexbox stands for 'flexible box'.
        It is a display type that comes with a range of properties 
        allowing you to arrange items easily.
        It's and alternative to using displays, floats, and other 
        layout properties.
    Flexbox Components
        A flexbox element is split into two main parts:
        the container, and the items.
        The container is the parent element in which the display type 
        is active. This is usually in the form of a div.
        Flex items are the child elements of the container, and they
        make up the contents of the box.
    Creating a Flex container
        flex containers use the display property, and for the value 
        you put flex.
    Flex Direction and Wrap
        with flex items, you can manipulate them with multiple properties.
        the first is 
        flex-direction
        and the values for this property are
        column, row, etc 
        and you can add -reverse to your value to reverse it.

        next is 
        flex-wrap
        what this does is wrap around to a new line.
        there are two values for this, being wrap and nowrap
        you can also reverse your wrap with -reverse on your value.
    Content alignment (Horizontal)
        justify-content, which is  responsible for horizontal alignment
        contains three main values and two special values
            The three common values are flex-start, flex-end, and center.
        flex-start is where the container starts,
        center is the center, 
        and flex-end is the end of the container.
            the two special values are 
        space-around, which creates spacing on all sides of items
        and space-between, which adds spacing between sides of items.
    Content alignment (vertical)
        align-items aligns items vertically, with the same three common
        values.
            the two special values for align-items are
        stretch, and baseline
        stretch makes an item align all the way through from top to bottom.
        baseline aligns items to a baseline, meaning no matter the size or font text or whatever,
        your stuff will stay on the same line.
    Flex Item Order
        in html, add the inline element
        style="order: num ;"
        and as the value for these properties,
        you're going to put either a 1,2,4,6, etc 
        based on what order you want your items to be in
